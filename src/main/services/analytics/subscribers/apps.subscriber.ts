/**
 * Apps Analytics Subscriber
 *
 * Wires AppManagerService and AppRuntimeService lifecycle events into
 * the analytics pipeline. Events are emitted as fire-and-forget telemetry
 * — handlers never block or throw into the business path.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - `app.installed` / `app.uninstalled` come from AppManagerService
 *   - `app.run.started` / `app.run.completed` / `app.run.failed` come from
 *     AppRuntimeService
 *
 * All properties forwarded here are structural identifiers (ids, specIds,
 * statuses, timestamps, durations). No user content, no prompts, no file
 * paths. The telemetry provider applies a second whitelist pass on top of
 * this, so additions here are still filtered if they aren't in the
 * per-event whitelist.
