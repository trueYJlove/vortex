# Halo

### 7×24 Desktop AI Agent for Everyone


Command your computer around the clock, drive an AI browser to complete tasks autonomously, with a friendly visual interface and full file management.

Write code, create presentations, research, draft reports, deploy servers, organize your desktop, automate browsers — if an Agent can do it, Halo supports it. Open source and free.

> **Our Philosophy:** Wrap complex technology into intuitive human interaction.

## Why Halo?

Halo is powered by Claude Code and carries the same Agent capability.

The difference: Halo brings that capability out of the terminal — giving it a visual home, an always-ready interface, and a Digital Human system that can run autonomously in the background 7×24.

No command line knowledge required. No environment setup. No staring at a screen waiting. Download, install, run — then tell it what you want done.

---

## Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Real Agent Loop
Not just chat. Halo can **actually do things** — write code, create files, run commands, and iterate until the task is done.

### Space System
Isolated workspaces keep your projects organized. Each Space has its own files, conversations, and context.

### Beautiful Artifact Rail
See every file AI creates in real-time. Preview code, HTML, images — all without leaving the app.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Remote Access
Control your desktop Halo from your phone or any browser. Work from anywhere — even from a hospital bed (true story).

### AI Browser
Let AI control a real embedded browser. Web scraping, form filling, testing — all automated.

### AI Digital Human System
Create and manage autonomous AI agents (Digital Humans) that run on a schedule or in response to events — monitoring, reporting, notifying, all in the background.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### And More...

- **Skills** — Install skill packs for your Agent to extend what it can do
- **Multi-provider Support** — Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, and any OpenAI-compatible API
- **Real-time Thinking** — Watch AI's thought process as it works
- **Dark/Light Themes** — System-aware theming
- **i18n Ready** — English, Chinese, Spanish (more coming)

---

## Digital Humans

Digital Humans are autonomous AI agents that work for you in the background — monitoring, summarizing, notifying, and acting — so you don't have to.

Browse and install them directly from the **Halo Digital Human Store**, no setup required.

> Think of them like apps on your phone, except they work *for* you automatically.

### For Users — Install in seconds

Open the Store in Halo, pick a Digital Human, configure a few fields, and it starts running. No code, no prompts, no manual effort.

Examples of what Digital Humans can do for you:

- Monitor prices and alert you when a deal drops
- Deliver a daily news or market digest every morning
- Watch your inbox and summarize what matters
- Track social mentions of your brand or product
- Run reports on a schedule and send them to your team

### For Developers — Build and publish

Want to contribute a Digital Human to the ecosystem? Write a `spec.yaml` and submit a PR to the [Digital Human Protocol (DHP)](https://github.com/openkursar/digital-human-protocol) registry — the open-source store and protocol behind Halo's Digital Humans.

Your agent becomes available to all Halo users instantly after merge.

### Build from Source

For developers who want to contribute or customize:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openkursar/hello-halo.git
cd hello-halo
npm install
npm run prepare        # Download binary dependencies for your platform
npm run dev
```

> To build for all platforms, run `npm run prepare:all` first to download binaries for every target platform.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Launch Halo** and enter your API key (Anthropic recommended)
2. **Start chatting** — try "Create a simple todo app with React"
3. **Watch the magic** — see files appear in the Artifact Rail
4. **Preview & iterate** — click any file to preview, ask for changes

> **Pro tip:** For best results, use Claude Sonnet 4.5 or Opus 4.5 models.

## What People Are Building

Halo isn't just for developers. We've seen:

- **Finance teams** building full-stack apps from scratch — with zero coding experience
- **Content creators** researching, writing, and organizing with AI in one flow
- **Operations teams** using Digital Humans to generate daily reports, monitor competitors, and summarize trends
- **Designers** prototyping interactive mockups
- **Students** learning to code with AI as their pair programmer
- **Developers** using the AI Browser for automated testing, scraping, and server deployment

The barrier isn't AI capability anymore. **It's accessibility.** Halo removes that barrier.

## The Story Behind Halo

In October 2025, it started with a simple frustration: **I wanted to use Claude Code, but I was stuck in meetings all day.**

During boring meetings (we've all been there), I thought: *What if I could control Claude Code on my home computer from my phone?*

Then came another problem — my non-technical colleagues wanted to try Claude Code after seeing what it could do. But they got stuck at installation. *"What's npm? How do I install Node.js?"* Some spent days trying to figure it out.

So I built Halo for myself and my friends:
- **Visual interface** — no more staring at terminal output
- **One-click install** — no Node.js, no npm, just download and run
- **Remote access** — control from phone, tablet, or any browser

The first version took a few hours. Everything after that? **100% built by Halo itself.** Since then, we've been using it 7×24.

AI building AI. Now in everyone's hands.
